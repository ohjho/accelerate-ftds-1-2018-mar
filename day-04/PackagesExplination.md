# Ploting

Python has many plotting libraries but the most popular are matplotlib and seaborn (which is a higher level wrapper for matplotlib). Matplotlib is the foundation from which much of the python visualization ecosystem is built ontop. For example we can plot from pandas but underneith it uses matplotlib, the same is true of seaborn. For a good overview of the python plotting ecosystem:

Matplotlib is great but a bit too low level at times, this means you end up writing way to much code to do something simple, therefore we'll focus on other libraries. However if you do wish to know more then checkout the anatomy of matplotlib:

What well cover for the matplotlib world:

* Seaborn - A great library allowing us to make complex plots with very little code.
 
Matplotlib main weakness is it can't do interactive plots so for these well use Plotly. Later we can also use plotly and dash to make interactive online dashboards for presenting data.

* Plotly - A library for making interactive plots with python.
